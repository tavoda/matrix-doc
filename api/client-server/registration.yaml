      summary: Register for an account on this homeserver.
      description: |-
        This API endpoint uses the `User-Interactive Authentication API`_.

        Register for an account on this homeserver.

        There are two kinds of user account:

        - `user` accounts. These accounts may use the full API described in this specification.

        - `guest` accounts. These accounts may have limited permissions and may not be supported by all servers.

        If registration is successful, this endpoint will issue an access token
        the client can use to authorize itself in subsequent requests.

        If the client does not supply a ``device_id``, the server must
        auto-generate one.

        The returned access token must be associated with the ``device_id``
        supplied by the client or generated by the server. The server may
        invalidate any access token previously associated with that device. See
        `Relationship between access tokens and devices`_.

            * ``M_INVALID_USERNAME`` : The desired user ID is not a valid user name.
            * ``M_EXCLUSIVE`` : The desired user ID is in the exclusive namespace
              claimed by an application service.

            These errors may be returned at any stage of the registration process,
            including after authentication if the requested user ID was registered
            whilst the client was performing authentication.

            Homeservers MUST perform the relevant checks and return these codes before
            performing User-Interactive Authentication, although they may also return
            them after authentication is completed if, for example, the requested user ID
            was registered whilst the client was performing authentication.
