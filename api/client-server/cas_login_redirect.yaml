      summary: Redirect the user's browser to the CAS interface.
      description: |-
        A web-based Matrix client should instruct the user's browser to
        navigate to this endpoint in order to log in via CAS.

        The server MUST respond with an HTTP redirect to the CAS interface. The
        URI MUST include a ``service`` parameter giving the path of the
        |/login/cas/ticket|_ endpoint (including the ``redirectUrl`` query
        parameter).

        For example, if the endpoint is called with
        ``redirectUrl=https://client.example.com/?q=p``, it might redirect to
        ``https://cas.example.com/?service=https%3A%2F%2Fserver.example.com%2F_matrix%2Fclient%2F%CLIENT_MAJOR_VERSION%%2Flogin%2Fcas%2Fticket%3FredirectUrl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fclient.example.com%252F%253Fq%253Dp``.
