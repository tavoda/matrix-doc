  This event specifies the minimum level a user must have in order to perform a
  certain action. It also specifies the levels of each user in the room.

  If a ``user_id`` is in the ``users`` list, then that ``user_id`` has the
  associated power level. Otherwise they have the default level
  ``users_default``. If ``users_default`` is not supplied, it is assumed to be
  0.

  The level required to send a certain event is governed by ``events``,
  ``state_default`` and ``events_default``. If an event type is specified in
  ``events``, then the user must have at least the level specified in order to
  send that event. If the event type is not supplied, it defaults to
  ``events_default`` for Message Events and ``state_default`` for State
  Events.

  If there is no ``state_default`` in the ``m.room.power_levels`` event, the
  ``state_default`` is 50. If there is no ``events_default`` in the
  ``m.room.power_levels`` event, the ``events_default`` is 0. If the room
  contains no ``m.room.power_levels`` event, *both* the ``state_default`` and
  ``events_default`` are 0.

  The power level required to invite a user to the room, kick a user from the
  room, ban a user from the room, or redact an event, is defined by ``invite``,
  ``kick``, ``ban``, and ``redact``, respectively. Each of these levels defaults
  to 50 if they are not specified in the ``m.room.power_levels`` event, or if
  the room contains no ``m.room.power_levels`` event.
